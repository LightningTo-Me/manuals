## Requesting a channel

#### What is this about?

[LightningTo.Me](https://lightningto.me) allows merchants and enthusiasts to request a channel from our relatively [well-connected and well-balanced node](https://1ml.com/node/03bb88ccc444534da7b5b64b4f7b15e1eccb18e102db0e400d4b9cfe93763aa26d). This page answers some frequently asked questions.

#### Why would anyone need that?

In order to receive payments through lightning network, nodes need to have so-called *inbound capacity*. The easiest way to get inbound capacity is to ask another node to open a channel to you. This is exactly what we offer.

#### How do I request a channel?

Go to https://lightningto.me, fill the form and press the button. That's it.

#### Are there any limitations?

Just please be nice. Only request a channel if you actually intend to keep it open and to use it.

#### What are the fees?

We set zero fees for the usage of our channels. When the network matures, we may increase the fees slightly, but we will always keep them unfairly low.

#### What is the catch?

There is no catch. We would like lightning network to succeed, and we see inbound capacity problem as one of the biggest obstacles to adoption. So we want to help.

#### How long will the channel stay open?

We will try to keep it as long as we can. We can close some channels if we need some on-chain funds, but only the channels that are not used / inactive.

#### Can I request a channel with more capacity?

Write to contact@lightningto.me about your use case and we will see what we can do. Usually we can allocate more funds for new merchants.

#### Are there any alternatives?

You can use [Bitrefill's Thor](https://medium.com/@bitrefill/2d6ffbad3906). It is great, check it out! Keep in mind though that it will cost you ~3 dollars a month for a 0.02 BTC channel.
